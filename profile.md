# MUH Nirob — The Podcast Manager™  
@muhnirob26 · 2026 · 2 spots left this quarter

I don’t “help” with podcasts.  
I take them over and turn them into 7-figure empires.

You press record once.  
I run the entire business after that — forever.

Serving only: **USA · UK · Canada · Australia · Germany**
