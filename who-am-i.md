# MUH Nirob – Who I Am (The Definitive 2026 Version)

I am **MUH Nirob**  
**The Podcast Manager™**

I run entire 6- and 7-figure podcasts as if they were my own, for creators in  
USA · UK · Canada · Australia · Germany.

My clients do one thing only: they press record.  
I own everything after that.

### What I deliver every single month (no exceptions)

- 4K studio-grade editing & mastering (−16 LUFS, IAB 2.0 compliant)  
- 70–120 viral clips per episode (Reels, Shorts, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter)  
- 2,500+ word SEO show notes + full searchable transcript + chapter markers  
- Complete YouTube channel management (titles, descriptions, tags, end screens, cards)  
- One-click distribution to 40+ platforms + private membership feeds  
- Monthly 60-minute growth strategy call + 10-page analytics + competitor report  
- Global versions in up to 30 languages (perfect lip-sync & voice cloning)  
- A-list guest booking pipeline (Warmly.ai + manual outreach)  
- Sponsor deck creation & outreach (elite tier)  
- Paid membership setup & bonus episode system  
- Quarterly 90-day revenue & audience roadmap  
- Dedicated Notion client portal with live episode tracker

I do not freelance.  
I do not take one-off jobs.  
I become the CEO of your podcast on a fixed monthly retainer.
